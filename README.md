## Pulsar

## DESCRIPTION

"Pulsar" is a text based adventure game that requires user input to play
In this game, the user will boarding on the Pulsar, a new space ship that is built to withstand virtually anything.
With this new technology, the user will be sent up into space and into the nearest black hole to explore what might lay beyond.
Depending on how the user plays the game, they will get beyond the black hole and what they discover may not be what they 
thought.The user will play through the game, responding to certain prompts in order to get further and further into the game. Certain
responses may end in death for the character, in which case the game would need to be restarted. Hopefully the player makes it through
the mission...alive.

1. https://sciencing.com/characteristics-eight-planets-8332488.html - I used this website (along with Wikipedia) to get general ideas on what types of conditions each planet had. While the conditions stated in the game are not entirely accurate, they are close to real-life. 
2. https://stackoverflow.com - Answers that other users posted on this website helped me figure out some small problems as I went through coding my game.
